# tune-recognition-hd

This program uses high dimensional vectors to recognize classical tunes.

Hugo Clarke from [BestClassicalTunes.com](BestClassicalTunes.com) generously shared his database of classical pieces and themes with me, located in the `data` folder, which made this project possible. Thank you Hugo :)
